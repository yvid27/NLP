On 01/26/2021 I did a tutorial about Natural Language Processing, NLP several questions arose, many were answered live. This is a list of those that were not answered:

1. Could you please share the Colab notebook?
Sure, https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V3kqbmEzFG7OMIqAcAjFRneqCK2TibBy?usp=sharing

2. Who or what organization is coordinating the event in Mexico?
You can find the information you require at the following link: http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/americasnlp/

3. Could you recommend a book to start with?
Some of the books are:
- Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing by Li Deng, Yang Liu
- Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing by Yoav Goldberg, Graeme Hirst
- Natural Language Processing in Action: Understanding, Analyzing, and Generating Text with Python by Hobson Lane, Hannes Hapke, Cole Howard
In addition, to start with NLP we have different resources: videos (many on YouTube), online courses (Stanford), Blogs, books, and others.

4. For the Spanish language, what technique is better to represent the characteristics (embeddings) if I have a classification task in levels?
A pre-trained language model is currently the best representation method for classification tasks.

5. If, for example, I want to measure levels of aggressiveness in comments, would it be included in Theme Modeling or Sentiment Analysis?
I'm not entirely sure, but the description of the problem is more related to the "hate speech detection / classification" task. Although I have not seen many datasets that classify it in different levels, it would be a matter of looking for one.

6. Is there a pre-trained model with words in Spanish which would be the most advanced?
There are several models that were designed under the concept of Transformers. In English we have BETO as one of the most used. To inquire about others you can check the following link: https://huggingface.co/transformers/.

7. What other social networks apart from Twitter allow the export of data for use in our investigations?
Other social networks that you can use in addition to Twitter are Facebook, Youtube, blogs, websites with free access to comments, and forums.

8. What is the approximate size of the corpus? Can it be processed on a mid-range computer?
As an additional resource, you could use cloud resources such as Amazon webservices (https://aws.amazon.com/) or Google's Colab (https://colab.research.google.com).

9. Could you give a hint of the computational requirement to use Transformers?
The Transformers demonstrated their great ability to solve different tasks in NLP. But, Transformers require more vram than other models. A 6Gb video card is recommended to be able to run some kind of small Transformer. The ideal is to look for one with more than 8Gb to be able to have more sizes.

10. How to jump from these steps to chatbots?
To take the step from one task in NLP to another, what you must do is research about it. You can search: Google Scholar, Springer, Elsevier, arXiv.org, ACM digital library. Also, there is the NLP-progress repository (http://nlpprogress.com/).

Thank you very much for your inquiries.
